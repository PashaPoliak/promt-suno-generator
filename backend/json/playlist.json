"prompt": "**Title: \"Scars of the Cross\"**\n\n*Verse 1: Before the Crucifixion*  \nThe whispers grow louder, the darkness descends,  \nA crown of thorns where love begins.  \nThe weight of the world, carried alone,  \nBeneath a sky that turns to stone.  \n\nIn the garden, He prayed, blood in the tears,  \nKnowing the end, yet facing the fears.  \nBetrayed by the kiss of a brother's hand,  \nHe walks the path, the Son of Man.  \n\n*Pre-Chorus*  \nNailed to the wood, the sins of the lost,  \nHe bears it all with the scars of the cross.  \nForgiveness pours from His beaten skin,  \nThe war for salvation now begins.  \n\n*Chorus*  \nScars of the cross, where mercy was found,  \nThe hands of the Savior nailed to the ground.  \nA love so pure, it breaks through the night,  \nThe scars of the cross bring eternal light.  \nScars of the cross, the price has been paid,  \nThrough His suffering, a way was made.  \nRisen from death, a victory won,  \nThe scars of the cross shine like the sun.  \n\n*Verse 2: The Crucifixion*  \nThe hammer falls, the crowd turns away,  \nAs Heaven weeps on that fateful day.  \nThe blood pours out, the skies turn black,  \nYet still, He whispers, \"I’ll be back.\"  \n\nWith every breath, He fights for grace,  \nHis love outshines the cruel embrace.  \nThe earth trembles, the veil is torn,  \nIn death, a new hope is born.  \n\n*Pre-Chorus*  \nNailed to the wood, the sins of the lost,  \nHe bears it all with the scars of the cross.  \nForgiveness pours from His beaten skin,  \nThe war for salvation now begins.  \n\n*Chorus*  \nScars of the cross, where mercy was found,  \nThe hands of the Savior nailed to the ground.  \nA love so pure, it breaks through the night,  \nThe scars of the cross bring eternal light.  \nScars of the cross, the price has been paid,  \nThrough His suffering, a way was made.  \nRisen from death, a victory won,  \nThe scars of the cross shine like the sun.  \n\n*Bridge: After the Crucifixion*  \nThree days of silence, the world held its breath,  \nBut death couldn’t hold Him, He shattered death.  \nThe stone rolled away, the chains fell free,  \nThe scars of the cross, now our victory!  \n\n*Chorus*  \nScars of the cross, where mercy was found,  \nThe hands of the Savior nailed to the ground.  \nA love so pure, it breaks through the night,  \nThe scars of the cross bring eternal light.  \nScars of the cross, the price has been paid,  \nThrough His suffering, a way was made.  \nRisen from death, a victory won,  \nThe scars of the cross shine like the sun.  \n\n*Outro*  \nScars of the cross, a love so divine,  \nEternal hope through His sacrifice.  \nThough the pain remains, His love never fades,  \nThe scars of the cross, forever engraved.  \n\n",
