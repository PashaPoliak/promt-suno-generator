Pre-chorus and Bridge in Suno Prompts
Using Pre-chorus and Bridge for Stray Lyrics
Pre-chorus
and
bridge
are for stray lyrics outside the main pattern. They build anticipation as the song transitions, and often don’t rhyme or appear to fit the meter.
Use the following metatags to label these sections:
[Pre-Chorus]
[Bridge]
Handling AI-generated Lyrics without Labels
AI-generated lyrics sometimes include a pre-chorus without labeling it, causing Suno to sing it as an awkward extra line that doesn’t fit the meter.
Adding a metatag label tells Suno this break in the song pattern is intentional, and it should be sung as its own pattern.

[Verse]
Wandering through the forest, lost and alone
Shadows creeping, the unknown has grown
Twisting paths, a labyrinth of trees
Every clearing, a deceptive tease
Fear is rising, it's clouding my mind
[Chorus]
Stumbling in darkness, searching for a way
I'm losing hope, running out of day
Edited to add a [Pre-chorus]:
[Verse]
Wandering through the forest, lost and alone
Shadows creeping, the unknown has grown
Twisting paths, a labyrinth of trees
Every clearing, a deceptive tease
[Pre-chorus]
**Fear is rising, it's clouding my mind**
[Chorus]
Stumbling in darkness, searching for a way
I'm losing hope, running out of day
Using Pre-chorus and Bridge in Different Positions

[Shout]
[Whimsical]
